# Junip-LandingPage-Clone
Clone of the Junip Platform Lading Page using Bootstrap 5

I used this project to put into practice the knowledge acquired with bootstrap 5. All the code was made with the standards offered by bootstrap including colors and fonts. With this project I was able to understand how the bootstrap grid, flebox and responsive works and practice the use of the bootstrap classes.You can use the link above in the project description to view the project.
